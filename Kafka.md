#### Question: 
What are the main components of Kafka?
#### Answer: 
Kafka's main components are Producers, Consumers, Topics, Partitions, Brokers, Zookeeper, and Kafka Connect. Producers publish messages to topics, Consumers read messages, Topics categorize messages, Partitions allow parallelism, Brokers store and serve messages, Zookeeper manages metadata, and Kafka Connect integrates with external systems.

#### Question: 
What is a Kafka topic?
#### Answer: 
A Kafka topic is a category or feed name to which records are published. Topics in Kafka are always multi-subscriber; that is, a topic can have zero, one, or many consumers that subscribe to the data written to it.

#### Question: 
How does Kafka achieve fault tolerance?
#### Answer: 
Kafka achieves fault tolerance through data replication. Each topic can have multiple partitions, and each partition can be replicated across multiple brokers. If a broker fails, another broker with the replicated partition can take over.

#### Question: 
What is a Kafka partition?
#### Answer: 
A Kafka partition is a division of a topic. Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of records that is continually appended toâ€”a commit log. Partitions allow Kafka to parallelize the processing of data.
